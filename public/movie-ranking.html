<h1>The Movies I've watched - by Bettina</h1>
<h2>The highlight of movies.</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>V for Vendetta (2005)</h3>
<p>Has the most beautiful dialogues, the story is very interesting, and the acting is amazing.</p>
<h3>The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014)</h3>
<p>It's a Wes Anderson movie. Love it or hate it, I don't think there is a gray area for feelings on Wes Anderson's creations. I love them.</p>
<h3>Everything Everywhere All At Once (2022) </h3>
<p>You're in for a headache of complexities and weirdness. Totally worth it.</p>
<h3>Predestination (2015)</h3>
<p>Another mind-boggling experience.</p>
